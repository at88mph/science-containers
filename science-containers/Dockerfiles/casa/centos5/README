At present, the files in this directory are to build a basic CentOS5 container
with all of the basic linux software dependencies needed for early CASA
versions (3.4 to 4.2).
The CentOS5 repos have lately been starting to fail (2/4 mirrors fail during
current builds, with various packages, etc).  So this base container will
allow us to address any future casa container upgrades without having to
count on the ongoing stability of the remaining two centos5 mirror sites.

UPDATE Feb 7, 2024: this code no longer builds a CentOS5 repo either, but
the one that built earlier is on harbor at skaha/centos.  The coding here
is left in place in case it becomes necessary to try to rebuild again using
another mirror site which is perhaps not broken yet.
