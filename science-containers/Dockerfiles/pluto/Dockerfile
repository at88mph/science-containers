# We want to set up Julia carefully.
# We want some packages e.g. Pluto backed into the container,
# and we want others to persist in the user's home folder.
# We also want JULIA_PROJECT set up so that by default they
# get the stack of their home packages ontop of the image packages.
# Finally, we need to load the registry while making this image
# but then need to clear it so that the user re-loads it into their 
# home folder (otherwise all package versions are frozen at the time
# this image is created).

# Pluto by default does track all notebook dependencies internally,
# but we want to fall back on best-practices if the user opts
# out of the default automatic handling.

# Install Pluto etc.

# This could be done more carefully by copying in a Julia Project.toml and/or Manifest.toml
# to ensure reproducibility. Here, we just get the latest versions of each.
# Once complete, create a custom "sys-image" to compile Pluto into the Julia binary.
# Then it will start almost instantly.
# We do this all in one step to avoid inflating the image size with temporary steps.

# One cautionary note about this approach: since these packages are now baked into the Julia
# binary (through PlutoSysImg.so) users can't download and load other versions. This is fine
# for e.g. Pluto but might cause issues if they install a new package that is incompatible with
# a transitive dependency like requiring an old version of HTML.jl
